    <p>
        I want to change my career and want to enter into the IT industry as a front 
        end developer. I love working with the html and css files and I am also planning
         to start learning the java script programming so i would be able to create more 
         efficiant professional looking websites. I love the magic of internet and the way 
         different websites are created by the professional developers. I think that i am a quick
         learner and my approach towards learning and completing the different tasks, assigned by 
         our mentor, has been a success and a great achievement. I also think that I am ready to
         jump into the ocean of IT with all my efforts and resources. I have always beeen looking
         forward to the oppertunities to bring positive change to my life and I hope this training 
         at Code Nation is going to be an important mile stone to my career.
