    <p> I am a 46 year old male and I have got my educational background from my home country, which is Pakistan. 
        I completed my BCs  (bachelor in computer sciences) in 1996 and after completing my degree, 
        I married to a british girl who was living in Denmark at that time. After completing the visa process, I 
        was able to move to Denmark in November 1997. I started to learn Danish language because that
         was the main language, which was spoken throughout the country for the purpose of communication. It was 
         a very difficult language and was very different from English language, which we were taught during the school and
        university. I managed to complete the basic levels of the danish language in the designated time and then crawled 
        slowly towards a bit higher level. In about one year time, I was able to communicate to the other people
        confidently and then I started my own grocery business. This business required a lot of time and enery. 
        I continued the business for about 10 years and then applied for the Danish nationality. 
        Once I was awarded with the Danish Nationality, I decided to move to England for family reunion and for
        the sake of my children's education. I moved to Uk in sept. 2010 and since then I have tried different works like
        takeaway business, delivery man, secure courrier and in the end as a private hire taxi driver. My children 
        are grown-up and they all are having good schooling and progression for their future. They always encourage start some new career. I feel like whether
        it's a bit late to start but I have a lot of passion and energy to become a good programer and thet is why 
        I joined Code Nation and here I feel like that I got a lot of knowledge improvement  and I will also get well 
        structured support to progress in the right direction.  </p>
