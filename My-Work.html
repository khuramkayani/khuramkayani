    <h1> My written work project Unit 1</h1>

    <p>
        1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p1>
        Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan. From multi-national 
        corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays 
        an important role. The reasons for the present use of computer technology in business can best be determined 
        by looking at how it is being used across the business world.<br>

        So I think the following can be main uses in todays fast growing world:<br><br>

        1.Communication Between Employees, Suppliers and Customers<br><br>
        2.Inventory Management Systems<br><br>
        3.Data Management Systems <br><br>
        4.Management Information Systems<br><br>
        5.Customer Relationship Management <br><br>
        
    </p1>

    <p>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
    </p>
    <br>

<p1>

    The skills, method and resources need would depend on the task the person was trying to complete
So now it comes to the point where, once we have defined how to plan ahead a nice proceeding to carry out our project, chosen the tools that can help us out when dividing tasks, and we have the fundamental skills (either individual or within a team) needed to make it happen it's time to decide how we should carry out our project depending on the task at hand.
So when it comes to deciding the adecuate technology that would better fit, some people tend to either be subjective (own personal experience, referrals) or uninformed (a similar project has been carried out in a certain manner that in some cases may not fit the one they are working on).
When approaching this question you need to be realistic and objective about your project. You need to determine the size and type of the project and it's complexity. When it comes to it, usually IT projects are divided into three groups

Simple: (business sites, small online stores) where the complexity it's not vert high and most of the functions are already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their functionality and appearance.

</p1>

<br>

<p>

  1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. 
</p>

<br>

<p1>
 (1) Set your purpose and goals. What is the purpose of your website? <br>

 (2) Create a budget<br>

 (3) Assign roles <br>

 (4) Create a content strategy<br>

 (5) Structure your website<br>

 (6) Create a mock-up <br>

 (7) Start designing <br>

 (8)Test it out <br>

</p1>

<p>
    1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects 
</p>

<p1>

    why do projects fail?<br><br>

    The most common reasons given for projects to fail were <br><br>
    
   1. Short term priorities taking over <br>
   2. The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear)<br>
   3. Trying to do too much work all at once<br>
   4. Silos between marketing and IT<br><br>
     
    
    However, there are some significant differences in the reasons mainstream businesses give for failures compared to those cited by top performing companies. Mainstream companies are more likely to suffer from planning problems: poor definition, unclear strategy, poor ongoing measurement and lack of alignment in the team.
</p1>

<p>
    1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
</p>

<p1>
    As we all know that the tool need depends on the task being undertaken. for this project the tools needed are already
     mentioned above, however before starting off on the projects one most strategic and plan-out what needs to be done 

The next step would then looking at the business behind the site. and their scale / size. This would then influence the 
type of website to be made to cope with their type of clients.
Companies generally fall under one or more of the following:<br>

(1) Simple: (business sites, small online stores) where the complexity it's not vert high and most of the functions are 
already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their
 functionality and appearance.
 <br>
(2) Medium: (larger online stores, national-scale portals...) such projects are usually built around frameworks, which 
are a functional block with predefined features, which increases the speed rate of the project but will probably come 
with some limitations when it comes to implementing features, but it will always be cheaper than using a High Level 
programming code.<br>
(3) Large: such as social networks, where the project's core is developed in a high level (HL) programming language
 and the need for functionality, flexibility and data exchange are at the highest level.<br>
</p1>

<p>
    1.6: Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.

</p>

<p1>

    I will begin this by using only my own knowledge. Starting with my PC and the internet, these 2 main technologies 
    helped me to achieve all my outcomes so far. Without them I'd probably would not achieve them. Using windows 10 and
     Microsoft edge, Google Chrome helped me to use the right websites and the programs. Also the assistance from my
    tutor/team leader in the slack website.<br>

Specific technologies:<br>
Trello is a tool that helps organise my projects. Trello is one of the most popular applications used by developers 
for creating web sites. I create a troll board for each project, create lists to categorise the tasks, colour and labe
l these tasks and distribute these tasks to different members of your team.
</p1>
<br><br>

<p>

    1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects 
</p>

<br><br>

<p1>
    The GDPR itself was an expansion on the DPA (Data Protection Act) which sets guidelines on how data is handled within the EU economic region.
    With regards to the GDPR’s to legal guidelines and constraints that affect a business that runs digital projects it's very similar to any other company, but with a special emphasis on copyright law (which we will disscuss later on) and data protection, which in Europe is underlined by the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation.
    This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
    Expansion made under the GDPR includes ;
    
    The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
    The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
    The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
    The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
    The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
    The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used
    The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
    The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
    The expansion was the union’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain

<p>
    2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
     in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
</p>
<br><br>

<p1>

    The use of IT tools and systems can improve the productivity and efficiency of work activities in a
variety of contexts. My approach to using the IT tools available has changed as I have had more experience using the
 various platforms. For example on <b>Trello Board</b>, I decided to divide my work in 5 different stages and I followed
 the work flow acording to the pace of my work and I think in that way I have done prety good work done in the given 
 time frame. If the website had been custom and not a blog of the assignment I would have used a different system and 
 might have used different software to execute the task in a better way I guess. The focuss of the teaching has been 
 around .html and .css so this would have been pointless using other stuff like <b>JavaScript</b> etc. just to show off.
 I think that <b> Visual Studio Code</b> is a wonderful software and mastering this can realy help someone to learn 
 coding and become a successful programmer. The best feature in VS code is that you can instantly check the progress of
 your website by saving your work and viewing it instantly
</p1>
<br><br>

<p>
    2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
</p>
<br>

<p1>
    I think the IT tools selected for the purpose of building my website has been good so for and propabably, there 
    could have been more effective tools around but the focus of using these tools have been, what we were taught  
    about, needs to be implemented on the website building project and show how much we have learnt from this purpose
    build course. <b>Visual Studio Code</b> and <b> Trello </b> have been fantastic tools for my project and I think that
    I would be able to learn <b>JavaScript</b> too using these basic softwares and I would be able to progress more 
    efficiently.
</p1>
<br><br>

<P> 2.3: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</P>
<br>
<p1>
    Life is a combination of strengths asd weaknesses. Like all my other coursemates I also tried to complete my
    website building project in it's best shape. I can classify my strengths and weaknesses as follows: <br>

<b>My strengths: </b><br>
(1) My teacher who helped on every step.<br>
(2) My previous knowledge in the website building.<br>
(3) My family efforts and support.<br>
(4) Work more efficiently from home environment.<br>
(5) Online resourses and Youtube video tutorials.<br>

<b>My weaknesses:</b><br>
(1) Online teaching have been a new experience for me. <br>
(2) The time management.<br>
(3) The frequency of work load.

</p1>
<br><br>

<p> 2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project </p>
<br>

<p1><b> I would have taken the following steps to make the further improvements to my project: </b><p1>
<br><br>
<p1>
(1) Look for ways to improve visibility and awareness of my website.
<br>
(2) As simplicity is the best policy so I should avoid to over-complicate the project.
<br>
(3) I should be making a time-table for the project to be completed in given time.
<br>
(3) Utilize my energies positively from start to finish.
<br>
(4) Communicate with my other coursemates more frequently to polish my skills.
<br>
(5) Set appropriate expectations and stick to them.
</p1>

<br><br>

<p>
     2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
</p>
<br>


<p1>

    In my opinion the use of the Trello board has been a great success. By using this tool, I was able to
    identify each and every stage of my project. This also enabled me to more easily track each component of the Project 
    and plan ahead more successfully and confidently.
    I do believe that my website meet up the required level of competency and it works as it was planned.
     Although I have previous website building
    experience, the process gave me a more appreciation for the lengthy leg work that goes into working from a blank 
    html file with no template or framework to pull from. 
    While I feel I could have done more, and I will when I get furthere chances to build up my career in IT industry.
    I also think that I did great in my class learning new skills and also my class participation has been great while 
    our course was going on a specific pase. The course at the Code Nation has helped a lot  in improving my IT knowledge 
    and I will be able to push my self to the next level without any difficulty.
    
</p1>
<br><br>

<p> 3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </p>
<br>

<p1>According to my point of you everything has its advantages and disadvantages too. Similarly using IT tools has<br>
    its own benifits and on the other hand it also has some drawbacks. So we can classify it as follows:<br><br>

   <b>Benifits of IT tools:</b> <br>

(1) Reducing the repetitive work.<br>
(2) Objective assessment.<br>
(3) Greater consistency and repeatability. <br>
(4) Easily accessing the information about testing. <br>
(5) Reusability of Automated Tests.<br>
(6) Detection of Defects.<br>
(7) Fast time to market a product. <br>
(8) Reducing Business Expenses.<br>
<br>
    <b> Drawbacks of IT tools: </b><br>
(1) Data Security and hacking of system. <br>
(2) Crime and Terrorism. <br>
(3) Complexity and training of the staff.<br>
(4) Social Disconnect.<br>
(5) Work Overload by the private companies <br>
(6) Digital Media Manipulation.<br>
(7) Job Insecurity.<br>

As in the second part of this question, it is asked that could I have been more efficient completing <br>
my project. So the answer is <B>YES</B>.  I think there are number of softwares and programs used in <br>
today's world and by using those tools ie; JavaScript adn C++ , I would be able to give a lot of extra <br>
effectiveness to my website.<br>
This project would have also been great, if we have to complete it as a team and I think everyone would<br>
have come with a great idea and it would have much easier as a task. 

</p1> 
<br><br>

<p>

    3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</p>
<br> <br>
<p1>
There are a lot of ways to improve the productivity and efficiency of a website but most<br>
comonly used things could be as follows:<br>

<b>(1) Images:</b> The images should be clear and easy to see 	Some of the images were pixelated <br>
                   I had to change the images and alter them according to the requirement of my website.<br>
<b>(2) Animation:</b> 	All the animation should work correctly and smoothly. The animation worked smoothly <br>	
No actions were required to make them work properly.<br>

<b>(3) Fonts: </b> 	All the fonts should be the same unless if they are a heading or title. Some of the text<br>
 was the wrong size and so I had to change the font size according to the requirement of website.<br>

 <b>(4) Colour Scheme:</b> Colour scheme in a website is very importent and the font colour should be chosen <br>
 according to the colour of the background otherwise it can be difficult to read. <br>

 <b>(5) Hyperlinks:</b> I made sure that all the hyperlinks in my website worked properly and the navigation bar <br>
 above each page took the viewer to the right page when clicked.
 
 <br><br>

 <p>

    3.3: Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
 </p>

 <br><br>

 <p1>

    The use of IT tools and systems can improve the productivity and efficiency of work activities in a
variety of contexts. <br>

 The skills and knowledge needed by the IT User to plan and review their use of
predefined or commonly used IT tools for activities that are at times non-routine or unfamiliar. As a
result of reviewing their work, they will be able to identify and use automated methods or
alternative ways of working to improve productivity.
An activity will typically be ‘non-routine or unfamiliar’ because:<br>

(1) the task or context is likely to require some preparation, clarification or research (to separate
the components and to identify what factors need to be considered, for example, time
available, audience needs, accessibility of source, types of content, message and meaning)
before an approach can be planned.<br>

(2) The techniques required will involve a number of steps and at times be non-routine or
unfamiliar.

(3) The use of out-dated software sometimes, creates a lot of problems for a developer so <br>
one should make sure that the software they are using is up to date version.<br>

What would I do differently next time ?

<br>
I think I will try to take part in discussions more and also using slack , I would try <br> 
make more frequent contact with my teacher and other coursemates.


 </p1>
 <br><br>
<p>  3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p>
<br>

<p1>

    In terms of testing digital solutions, I would start small - testing individual elements of the project 
    as they are composed to ensure they are functioning as designed. Once tested at the smaller level, I would 
    integrate/add to larger elements and test that they perform the desired outcome in the larger context. As 
    the solution becomes bigger and more complex I would ask someone else to test the solution to check that 
    there isn't anything that I am missing. If the solution has a customer requirement then it would be advisable 
    to have the end product tested by customers, to ensure they are happy with the product and design. Throughout 
    all of these testing phases, I would seek feedback on what has been done to incorporate better practice/
    customer-experience as the product becomes more complete.

<h1> My written work project Unit 2</h1>
    
    <p>Describing the content and layout for each page <br><br> </p>

     <p2> 
         A bit about my website project: <br> <br>
         I decided to write down a website which is all about me and my day to day life. I also decided that instead 
         of writting in just plain and boring text, I must used some css and html coding to improve the quality of my 
         website. I used different font size for differnt lines just to differentiate the taxt and stages of my page. 
         Although it has been very challenging to use the codes properly without any previous knowledge of programming,
          there has been good resourses on the internet and also our mentor Mr. Jay helped us a lot throughout the 
          project. I enjoyed the way html and CSS work together in website creation and also the magic of command and 
          it's execution made me excited throughout my website building project. I think if I get more time and 
          resources, I will be able to build more complexed and better structured websites with more passion.
         <br> <br>
         <b>1.2 Plan and create your website <br>
            
            <br></b>
         Planning about website creation:<br> <br>
         I planned to build a website about me. It is because I am going to start a new career in IT
         so I think other people who would visit my website would be able to understand my personality
         and my previous skills. As my mentor Mr. Jay told me that IT industry is full of oppertunities
         and more you explain yourself, more understanding about you can be achieved by the other people.
         In our online class we always learned about each other while discussing some new topic or taking
         part in creating something new and then presenting it to the rest of the coursemates.So over All
         I guess it has been a great success and a great way of learning. While browsing different websites,
         I always look at their design and the theme used to structure its main body. I think every persona
         has a different approach and different way of presentation. I feel like we wouldn't have learned 
         that much, if we were spoon fed like a lot of other institutes. Building my own website the way I 
         have created, has given me a lot of confidence and a positive energy towards learning new skills.
         <br> <br>

         <b>  1.3 Selecting and using web site features and structure </b><br><br>
         Selecting and using web site features and structure: <br><br>
         As you decide to create a website, first you have to decide the layout of the website and then also
         the content of the website is very important. As I decided to create my website about me, so I decided
         to break my website in different pages, each discussing different dimentions of my day to day life.
         so there has not been any hard and fast rules that how its going to be but I focussed more on the 
         structure and the functionality of my website. I didn't want to have any broken links or image not 
         loadinf scenarios here and there. So I have tried hard to run it the way I wanted and I leave rest on
         you, if you like it or not. <br><br>


         <b>  1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent </b><br><br>
         Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent <br><br>
         Well selecting the style option in html file was not allowed at this stage because i think they just 
         want us to design other commands. I think that has also been good and styling the website without
         using style command has been a littel challenge but I think it has been a success as well , because I 
         learned alternative methods of doing the same task. My website has been a simple structured one with 
         five different pages. I named each page as follows:<br><br>
         . Home page <br><br>
         . About Me <br><br>
         . My Hobbies <br><br>
         . My Future Plans <br><br>
         . Contact Me<br><br>
        </p2>  
        
        <P>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</P>
        <br>

        <p2> 
            This is my completed asset table. <br>
2. Explanation of "copyright and licensing" <br>

Finding stock objects and existing implementations is often quicker, cheaper and more practical than producing your own. Whether free or not, these resources normally come with a license to ensure fair use.<br>

Licenses are granted by an authority to allow a usage; in my case, the use and distribution of resources by the copyright owner (i.e. me). I may decide to offer my photograph for free or charge a price; either way, I can include a license to limit usage, and I maintain the copyright. Just because someone pays money doesn’t mean they have full control or rights to what they’re buying.<br>
What Is “Fair Use?
”“Fair use” is an exception to the exclusive rights held by the copyright owner. It exists in some countries such as the US and UK. Under it, in certain cases, using work without permission is possible. If someone’s usage is defined as fair use, then they don’t need to obtain a license. Essentially, using copyrighted material is a legal right. Examples of fair use might include:<br>

Educational purposes, such as teaching and student research;<br>
Making commentary and criticism as part of a news report or published article. <br>

Copyright - Creative artist's control of original work: the legal right of creative artists or publishers to control the use and reproduction of their original works. You have to have permission before using it.<br>

Licensing - Permission to use something for your own reasons. e.g if you have authorization to use something like a song or an image. <br>
             </p2>

             <p>

                1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account<br> - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them ?<br><br>

             </p>

             <p2>
                This section describes several general groupings of disabilities, and how they affect access to the Web. There are no universally accepted or absolute categorizations of disability. Disability terminology varies from country to country, and between different disability communities in the same country. Abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such as a visual and hearing disability together. This particular combination of disabilities is described below:
            <br>
            
Blindness:<br>
Blindness involves a substantial uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes.

To access the Web, most individuals who are blind rely on screen readers (software that reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice) and/or refreshable braille displays (a device that dynamically displays lines of text on the screen in braille). Some people who are blind prefer text-based browsers to graphical browsers<br><br>

Low vision:<br>
There are many types of low vision, including poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field),
central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision.

To use the Web, some people with low vision use extra-large monitors and increase the size of system fonts and images. Others use screen magnification or screen enhancement software. Some individuals prefer specific combinations of text and background colors, such as a 24-point bright yellow font on a black background, or choose certain typefaces that they find especially legible.<br><br>

Colour Blindness:<br>
Color blindness is a lack of sensitivity to certain colors. Common forms of color blindness include difficulty distinguishing between red and green, or between yellow and blue. Sometimes color blindness results in the inability to perceive any color.

To use the Web, people with color blindness may use their own style sheets to override the font and background color choices of the developer.<br><br>  

Deafness:<br>
Deafness involves a substantial uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears. Some deaf individuals' first language is a sign language, and they may or may not be fluent readers of a written language.

To use the Web, people who are deaf may rely on captions for audio content.<br><br.


            </p2>
            
<p>
    1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites ? 
</p>            
<br>
As there are many different file formats to choose from, but I have selected the 
four I  think work best on the web pages: <br><br><br>
(1) JPEG<br><br>
(2) PNG<br><br> 
(3) SVG<br><br> 
(4) GIF<br><br>

 All of these file types contain lossless compression and are used widely by the website developers.
